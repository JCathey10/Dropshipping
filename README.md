# Dropshipping
This is an e-commerce web app with PayPal integration.

This e-commerce site was developed by my Capstone 2020 team at Lane Community College. Our client for this project owns
a local sports store that specializes in printing services. He needed a site that functioned as a standard e-commerce
platform, but one that also allowed local teams to come and build their own team page on the website. The team page
displays items for sale, including team uniforms, hoodies, hats, and other custom printed specialty clothing. The site
was built using ASP.NET Core 3.1. Some of the features for this site include a cart system, checkout using PayPal,
account management, team management, ASP.NET Identity, and custom roles have been established.
